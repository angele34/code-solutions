   // -  Message values (with data type of struct msgTag) are added/stored in the Msg[] array starting from index 0. 
   //    The 1st message is thus stored in Msg[0], the 2nd message in Msg[1], the 3rd message in Msg[2] and so on...
   // -  The n_msgs member indicates the number of messages stored in the Msg[] array.  For example, when the value of
   //    n_msgs is 3, it means that there are three messages which are stored in Msg[0], Msg[1] and Msg[2].
   // - The oldest message, in terms of date and time, in Msg[0].  The most recent message is stored in Msg[n_msgs - 1].
